# Java Snake Game

## Description
Welcome to the Java Snake Game, a classic and entertaining arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer while avoiding collisions with obstacles and the snake's own body.

In this game, you take control of a hungry snake with the goal of eating as much food as possible to increase your score. The challenge lies in maneuvering the snake efficiently to avoid running into walls and, more importantly, running into yourself.

The game's simplicity and addictiveness make it a timeless classic that's both fun and challenging. How long can you grow your snake before it's game over?
